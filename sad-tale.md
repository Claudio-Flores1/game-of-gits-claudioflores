House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.

Ned's donute stand was an incredible success, the people of Westeros loved donuts so much that they stopped cutting body parts off of other people and lived in relative peace and donut harmon for a thousand years. 

It would've been a great first season if Ned Stark would've continued to live and then gone on to fight the baddies with his daughter in the season finale.
